# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
A tamper‑proof voting dApp enabling transparent, one‑person‑one‑vote elections without centralized control. Voters interact directly with the smart contract, ensuring an immutable, publicly verifiable tally.

## Project Vision
Empower communities, NGOs, and decentralized organizations with a trust‑minimal voting mechanism that eliminates the need for third‑party auditors and guarantees ballot integrity.

## Key Features
- **Owner‑managed lifecycle** (candidate registration, start, end)  
- **One vote per address** enforced on‑chain  
- **Transparent, real‑time result queries** available to anyone  
- **Event logs** for off‑chain analytics and UI updates  
- **Modular design** ready for Chainlink VRF or ZK proof upgrades

## Future Scope
- Integrate zero‑knowledge proofs for secret ballots  
- Add Chainlink VRF to randomize candidate order on UI  
- Extend to multi‑election support in a single contract  
- Governance module for community‑driven parameter changes

## Contract Details
> _To be completed manually by the maintainer (address, ABI, gas stats, etc.)._
